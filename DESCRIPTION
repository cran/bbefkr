Description: Estimating optimal bandwidths for the regression mean function approximated by the functional Nadaraya-Watson estimator and the error density approximated by a kernel density of residuals simultaneously in a scalar-on-function regression. As a by-product of Markov chain Monte Carlo, the optimal choice of semi-metric is selected based on largest marginal likelihood.
